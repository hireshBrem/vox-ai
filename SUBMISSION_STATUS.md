## 🎯 Scoring Estimate (Based on Current State)

With demo video completed, you should score well in all categories:

- **Technical Soundness (20%):** ~17-18 points (excellent architecture, minor benchmark gaps)
- **Agentic Behavior (20%):** ~18-19 points (strong implementation, well documented)
- **Memory Design (20%):** ~16-17 points (solid implementation, some enhancements possible)
- **Affective Intelligence (10%):** ~9 points (excellent use of Hume AI)
- **Real-World Value (10%):** ~10 points (thorough market analysis)
- **Completeness (10%):** ~8-9 points (need demo video)
- **Innovation Mashup (5%):** ~5 points (3 APIs well integrated)
- **Creativity & Polish (5%):** ~4-5 points (need engaging demo)

**Estimated Total: 87-93/100** (With demo video: A/A+ range)

## 💡 Tips for Success
